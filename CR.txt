1) intead of calling getBooks() inside renderBook() all the time I
will just put getBooks() inside renderBook()
2) onCreateBook() --> change the name to onShowCreateBookModal(), 
because we only showing our modal
3) onCreateBookReady() --> change the name to onCreateBook()
4) onUpdateBook() --> change the name to onShowUpdateBookModal(),
because we only showing our modal
5) onUpdateBookReady() --> change the name to onUpdateBook()
6) var bookObj = { name: document.querySelector('.name-input').value
, price: document.querySelector('.price-input').value }; --> 
first its a very long sentence which is hard to read, second
contorller should not bulid objects, just send arguments to 
book.sercies and book.services can bulid object if needed
7) onCreateBook & onUpdateBook() should only send arguments to 
createBook () & updateBook() at the book.serices and render, 
it should not do more document.querySelector, and manipulations code, 
that should happen at onShowUpdateBookModal() & onShowCreateBookModal()
8) onSort() --> not clear, the click should on price div or title div
and not on titls div (all row), or I could have used two buttons for
that, or I could put a select option
9) gIsSortByName --> should be somehow deleted, or it should be at the
book.services and not in the controller, if I fix comment (8) then I
dont need this vairable
10) paging --> onPageNext() and onPagePrev() should not contain gPage,
and they should not know about it, they should just call function at
the book.services, controller should not know about variables in the
book.serives, it should just get data and send data to it by
functions. so there should be distinct seperation between
controller and book.serices
11) flex of books-container will not change its size!! this is due to
the images of the book which dont let the flex-grow sizes to work,
therefore I can set flex-grow to change size
12) align-items would not work!! because each div contains just text
in it, and flex is working only on elements, therefore flex cannot
catch the text, in order to center by align-items i should put all
the text in <span> which is an elements which flex can handle
